        <h2>Joanna's journey</h2>
        <h3>Tourist guide in Dutch, English and Greek</h3>
        <p>
          Joanna is a certified tour guide with over 30 years of experience leading tours across Cyprus. 
          She completed her education and earned her tour guide diploma in the Netherlands, where she spent 
          part of her youth, and obtained the equivalent certification from the Cyprus Ministry of Tourism 
          when she returned to her homeland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming from a family of archaeologists, she has a strong connection to the island’s history and culture, 
          which she shares with enthusiasm.

        <p>
          Joanna believes that the best way to experience Cyprus is through interactive and participatory tours, 
          allowing visitors to actively engage with the island’s culture, history, and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her free time, she works as a beekeeper—one of the few women in Cyprus doing this—and runs a small 
          farm with chickens, fruit trees, and plants. She’s also a mom of three and the owner of three dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re interested, Joanna can arrange a beekeeping tour where you’ll learn about the process and enjoy 
          a honey tasting with her own locally produced honey.
